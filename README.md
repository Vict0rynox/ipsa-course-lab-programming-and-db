#### TODO
- check swagger docs endpoint work
- did not figure out with prometheus metrics correct setup
- x-request-id should be a part of response header

#### How to check this work(test/run)
- ```bash docker-compose up -d``` 
- verification via test ```bash sbt test``` or install ZIO plugin and run as regular test
- manual run `MainApp` all configs target so it can start without any tricks with env variables

#### This is a mix for 2 ipsa course labs
- OOP programming(done in Scala, app is just simple CRUD(storage in db), 
- Databases work and design

#### NOTE. Will never add this on real project, but for course lab demo there exists 
- foreign keys constraints 
- insert constraint check, that references other tables 
- triggers
